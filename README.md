# Linked Diagram Navigator
=================

Linked VSCode Navigator for StarUML 3. This extension lets the user navigate to a file and pattern in VSCode. It is designed for me to be able to draw up a diagram, and then tag various elements with VSCode locations and jump to them quickly.

## Usage

Add file:pattern to the first line of the doc of an element. E.g. src/test.ts:private findFiles

Then to navigate to the element, right click on it and choose "Select in VSCode"
